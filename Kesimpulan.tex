\chapter{Conclusion and Suggestion}
This chapter describes conclusions of this final project that has been done and also suggestions which contain the things that should be considered for further development. The conclusions and suggestions are described in detail in the following sub-chapters:
\section{Conclusion}
Based on the results of this final project that has been done, can be drawn conclusions that refers to the objectives into the following subsection:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All objectives are successfully designed implemented using NVD-based KNN approach

\item NVD-based KNN and basic KNN has 100\% accuracy levels which means both algorithms always return correct k-nearest emergency units.

\item NVD-based KNN outperforms basic KNN in execution time by a factor of 1.05 to 14.25 depending on the value of k for determining nearest emergency units.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Suggestion}
Suggestions that can be submitted from the results of this study for further research development are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Adding another emergency services.
\item Finding k-nearest emergency unit based on travel time by considering road conditions.
\end{enumerate}
